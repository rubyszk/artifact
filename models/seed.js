    'history': 'The Guggenheim Museum is an art museum located on the upper east side of Manhattan. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its current name after the death of its founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, in 1952. In 1959, the museum moved from rented space to its current building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, was conceived as a "temple of the spirit". Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. The building underwent extensive expansion and renovations in 1992 (when an adjoining tower was built) and from 2005 to 2008',

    'history': 'Once a crowded two-acre site occupied by thirty-one buildings on the last remaining block of the notorious Five Points slum, the Chatham Towers development was part of a greater slum clearance project that drastically reshaped the Civic Center area north of the Brooklyn Bridge and east of Centre Street stretching into Chinatown. Built by the Committee of Middle Income Housing under the Title I Housing Act, the two board-formed concrete high-rises known as Chatham Towers house 120 units, half of which have a terrace. Following decades of red brick apartment blocks, Chatham Towers was a departure from New York City housing, having more in common with British post-war housing.',

    'tags': ['brutalist', 'nyc'],
    'history': '33 Thomas Street, also known as the AT&T Long Lines Building is one of Manhattans most unusual skyscrapers - a building made for machines, not people. The building’s stepped massing, extruded volumes, and uniform rugged materiality represent hallmarks of brutalism, but instead of expressing functionality in the service of communities, institutions, or individuals it articulates the needs of the machines inside. The windowless mass occupies the block bounded by Broadway, Church, Worth and Thomas Streets, with a privately owned public plaza on its east side. Designed by architect John Carl Warnecke in 1969 for AT&T, 33 Thomas took 5 years to construct. A row of historic cast-iron loft buildings on the site had to be razed in the process. However, their facades were preserved. Warnecke designed the structure to resist a nuclear fallout and made it self-sufficient for 1,500 people to survive inside its walls for two weeks, with water and food for the occupants and 250,000 gallons of fuel to power generators.',

A church only becomes a basilica when the pope designates it, usually because of historical significance or if it houses sacred relics. Globally, there are over 1,400 minor basilicas; however, St Peter’s Basilica is one of only four Major Basilicas in the world. The three other major basilicas are also situated in Rome: St John Lateran, St Paul’s outside the Walls and St Mary Major. St Peter’s Basilica achieved its basilica status due to being built on the site where St Peter was buried in 64 AD.',
